This is an encrypted python socket chat room utilizing the RSA, json and binascii libraries


The purpose of our project is to utilize encryption in a local chat server to enhance security of a direct message. This was accomplished by using a socket to establish a connection and we used the threading library to separate two processes. The server and client both use json to store and exchange the data between the clients and the server. We utilized the RSA library to generate keys sent from a client message with a digital signature.
